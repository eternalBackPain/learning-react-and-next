# learning-react-and-next

Things to consider when building modern applications:
- User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
- Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how - you connect to them.
- Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
- Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- Developer Experience - your teamâ€™s experience building and maintaining your application.

Reach = UI
Next.js = framework for things like routing, data fetching, integrations


## Vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation:

To create a new element and add content to it: 
createElement --> createTextNode --> appendChild (append content/textnode to the element) --> appendChild (append new element to whereever in the doc you want it)
        
        // Select the div element with 'app' id
        const app = document.querySelector('#app')

        // Create a new H1 element
        const header = document.createElement('h1');

        // Create a new text node for the H1 element
        const headerContent = document.createTextNode(
            'Develop. Preview. Ship. ðŸš€',
        );

        // Append the text to the H1 element
        header.appendChild(headerContent);

        // Place the H1 element inside the div
        app.appendChild(header);


## USING REACT

Use the CDN scripts (see index.js)

imperative writing = step-by-step
delcarative writing = ordering the pizza --> react = declarative UI lib

    const app = document.querySelector('#app')
    ReactDOM.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship. ðŸš€</h1>, app);

Three core concepts of React:
- Components (= building blocks; = function that returns UI elements)
- Props (= you can design components that accept custom arguments (or props) that change the componentâ€™s behavior or what is visibly shown when itâ€™s rendered to the screen. Then, you can pass down these props from parent components to child components.)
- State (e.g. a toggle button that shows on or off; e.g. use state to store and increment the number of times a user has clicked the like button)


## USING NEXT.JS (a lot of the above becomes unnecessary as Next.js handles it)

no need for CDN scripts - use npm instead:
    
    npm install react react-dom next

- no more need for an index.html file as Next.js creates html and body tags
- no more need for Babel script because Next.js has a compiler that transforms JSX into valid JavaScript browsers can understand.
- move the new index.js file into a 'pages' folder
- Add default export to your main React component to help Next.js distinguish which component to render as the main component of this page.
- Add a script to your package.json file to run the Next.js development server while you develop.
    {
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev"
    },
- next has fast refresh so that you dont need to run 'npm run dev' when you make a change and save a file

In sum:
1. create index.js
2. npm install react react-dom next
3. Include the following code to index.js as a skeleton:
    
    export default function HomePage() {
        return (
            <div></div>
        );
    }

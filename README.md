# Creating React and Next.js apps

1. First-app contains a very quick app created using Next.js: npm install react react-dom next.
2. React-app is a runthrough of the official React tutorial that creates a tic-tac-toe app to learn the concepts of components, props and state.
3. next-app is a runthrough of the 'create your first app' tutorial from Next.js (basically a more comprehensive app than the one above): npx create-next-app@latest.
4. react-task-tracker is a runthrough of a Traversy Media crash course on React

This is a whole other beast to tackle - not sure how much time I should invest into full stack web development.

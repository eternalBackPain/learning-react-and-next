1. npm start
2. index.js references App.js which renders the single page app
3. create a folder for components and import those components into App.js or other components
4. props are the parameters to each component (pass them into the const and 'construct' the component in App.js as you would an xml tag)
5. got lazy writing these notes - refer to src files for comments
